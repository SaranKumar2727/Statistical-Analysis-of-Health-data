Health Data Statistical Analysis - Diabetes

Overview

Welcome to the Health Data Statistical Analysis project focused on diabetes. 
This project aims to provide a comprehensive statistical analysis of health data related to diabetes.
The analysis is divided into five main components, each serving a specific purpose in understanding and interpreting the data. 
The analyses include parametric analysis (Analysis-2), non-parametric analysis (Analysis-3), categorical analysis (Analysis-4), and determining the sample size (Analysis-5).

Project Structure
Analysis-2: Parametric Analysis
In this section, statistical methods assuming a certain distribution of the data are employed. 
Parametric tests, such as t-tests and z-tests, are applied to analyze the relationships and differences within the diabetes health data.

Analysis-3: Non-Parametric Analysis
This section focuses on non-parametric statistical methods that do not rely on specific distribution assumptions.
Tests like the Mann-Whitney U test are utilized to analyze variables related to diabetes without assuming a particular data distribution.

Analysis-4: Categorical Analysis
The categorical analysis section investigates the relationships and dependencies among categorical variables related to diabetes. 
Techniques like chi-squared tests are applied to assess associations and significance.

Analysis-5: Sample Size Determination
Determining an appropriate sample size is crucial for the reliability of statistical analyses. 
In this section, methodologies and calculations are presented to guide the determination of an optimal sample size for future studies or experiments related to diabetes.
